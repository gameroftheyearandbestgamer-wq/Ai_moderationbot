# Moderation AI Prototype

This is a small prototype for a moderation AI written in Python.  
The script scans messages and flags content based on simple keyword rules.  

## Features

- Prints flagged messages to the console.
- Easy to expand into layered moderation with repositories.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script with:

3. Enter sample messages to see how it works.

## Future Plans
- Add layered moderation (spam, toxicity, NSFW, etc.).
- Connect to external repos for advanced AI models.
- Expand configuration options.
